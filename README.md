# ShallowWaterEquations
Solutions based on different schemes.  
Here is Semi-Lagrangian bi-cubic interpolation, with filter for short wavelengths.
Periodic grid with a mountain on the bottom of the ocean. The governing equations are

As seen these are the Lagrangian form of the equations, following trajectories of water particles.
